# Technical Neural Networks

You can find useful Java code for the following topics: Perceptron, multi-layer perceptron (MLP),
radial-basis function nets (RBF), back-propagation of error, self organizing feature maps (SOMS, Kohonen).

# In The Future

More documented Java code will be added covering these areas: Hopfield nets, adaptive resonance theory (ART), 
learning vector quantization, recurrent networks, reinforcement learning, Q-learning, support vector machines (SVM), 
pulse processing neural networks.

# Application Areas

Updated repository will serve for the following application areas: function approximation, prediction, quality control, 
image processing, speech processing, action planning, control of technical processes and robots. 
Implementation of neural networks in hardware and software: tools, simulators, analog and digital neural hardware.
