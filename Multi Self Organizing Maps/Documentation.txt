To run the program just type

java MSOMTraining

in command line. Make sure that train_PA-E.dat file is in the same directory as the class file itself. PA-E.net file contains results of calculations. 
You can also look at learning.txt file. I used M=4, g=2 3x3 SOMs for testing. The program has textual user interface which will help you at runtime.
